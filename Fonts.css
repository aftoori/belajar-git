p.normal {
  font-style: normal;
}

p.italic {
  font-style: italic;
}

p.oblique {
  font-style: oblique;
}
Font Weight
The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font:

Example
p.normal {
  font-weight: normal;
}

p.thick {
  font-weight: bold;
}
Font Variant
The font-variant property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font.

In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.

Example
p.normal {
  font-variant: normal;
}

p.small {
  font-variant: small-caps;
}
Exercise
?

h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

p {
  font-size: 14px;
}
Tip: If you use pixels, you can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page.

Set Font Size With Em
To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.

1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.

The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em

Example
h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em; /* 40px/16=2.5em */
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.875em; /* 30px/16=1.875em */
}

p {
  font-size: 0.875em; /* 14px/16=0.875em */
}
In the example above, the text size in em is the same as the previous example in pixels. However, with the em size, it is possible to adjust the text size in all browsers.

Unfortunately, there is still a problem with older versions of Internet Explorer. The text becomes larger than it should when made larger, and smaller than it should when made smaller.

Use a Combination of Percent and Em
The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element:

Example
body {
  font-size: 100%;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.875em;
}

p {
  font-size: 0.875em;
}
Our code now works great! It shows the same text size in all browsers, and allows all browsers to zoom or resize the text!

Responsive Font Size
The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:

Hello World
Resize the browser window to see how the font size scales.

Example
<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.
