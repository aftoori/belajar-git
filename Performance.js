const obj = document.getElementById("demo");
obj.innerHTML = "Hello";

Reduce DOM Size
Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small.

This will always improve page loading, and speed up rendering (page display), especially on smaller devices.

Every attempt to search the DOM (like getElementsByTagName) will benefit from a smaller DOM.

Avoid Unnecessary Variables
Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save values.

Often you can replace code like this:

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;
With this:

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName;
Delay JavaScript Loading
Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first.

While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. In addition all parsing and rendering activity might be blocked.

The HTTP specification defines that browsers should not download more than two components in parallel.

An alternative is to use defer="true" in the script tag. The defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.

If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page has loaded:

Example
<script>
window.onload = function() {
  const element = document.createElement("script");
  element.src = "myScript.js";
  document.body.appendChild(element);
};
</script>
