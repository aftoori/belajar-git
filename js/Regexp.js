/w3schools/i;
Example explained:

/w3schools/i  is a regular expression.

w3schools  is a pattern (to be used in a search).

i  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).

Using String Methods
In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace().

The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

Using String search() With a String
The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match:

Example
Use a string to do a search for "W3schools" in a string:

let text = "Visit W3Schools!";
let n = text.search("W3Schools");
The result in n will be:

6

Using String search() With a Regular Expression
Example
Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string:

let text = "Visit W3Schools";
let n = text.search(/w3schools/i);
The result in n will be:

6

Using String replace() With a String
The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:

let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
Use String replace() With a Regular Expression
Example
Use a case insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string:

let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace(/microsoft/i, "W3Schools");
The result in res will be:

Visit W3Schools!
Did You Notice?
Regular expression arguments (instead of string arguments) can be used in the methods above.
Regular expressions can make your search much more powerful (case insensitive for example).

Regular Expression Modifiers
Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches:

Modifier	Description	Try it
i	Perform case-insensitive matching	
g	Perform a global match (find all)	
m	Perform multiline matching	
d	Perform start and end matching (New in ES2022)	
Regular Expression Patterns
Brackets are used to find a range of characters:

Expression	Description	Try it
[abc]	Find any of the characters between the brackets	
[0-9]	Find any of the digits between the brackets	
(x|y)	Find any of the alternatives separated with |	
Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

Metacharacter	Description	Try it
\d	Find a digit	
\s	Find a whitespace character	
\b	Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b	
\uxxxx	Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx	
Quantifiers define quantities:

Quantifier	Description	Try it
n+	Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?	Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
Using the RegExp Object
In JavaScript, the RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods.

Using test()
The test() method is a RegExp expression method.

It searches a string for a pattern, and returns true or false, depending on the result.

The following example searches a string for the character "e":

Example
const pattern = /e/;
pattern.test("The best things in life are free!");
Since there is an "e" in the string, the output of the code above will be:

true

You don't have to put the regular expression in a variable first. The two lines above can be shortened to one:

/e/.test("The best things in life are free!");
Using exec()
The exec() method is a RegExp expression method.

It searches a string for a specified pattern, and returns the found text as an object.

If no match is found, it returns an empty (null) object.

The following example searches a string for the character "e":

Example
/e/.exec("The best things in life are free!");
The RegExp.escape() Method
The RegExp.escape() method returns string where characters that belongs to the regular expression syntax are escaped.

This makes it possible to treat characters like +, *, ?, ^, $, (, ), [, ], {, }, |, and \ literally, and not as part of a regular expression.

Example
Create a regular expression that matches the string "[*]":

// Escape a text for to use as a regular expression
const safe = RegExp.escape("[*]";

// Build a new reglar expression
const regex = new RegExp(safe);

// Text to replace within
const oldText = "[*] is a web school.";

// Perform the replace
const newText = oldText.match(regex, "W3Schools");
