JavaScript Array Rest Elements
ECMAScript 2018 added the rest operator (...).

The rest operator (...) allows us to destruct an array and collect the leftovers:


Example 1
let a, rest;
const arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];

[a, ...rest] = arr1;
Example 2
let a, b, rest;
const arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];

[a, b, ...rest] = arr1;
JavaScript Object Rest Properties
ECMAScript 2018 added the rest operator (...).

This allows us to destruct an object and collect the leftovers onto a new object:

Example
// Create an Object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Destructure the Object
let {type, model, color} = car;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The car type is: " + type;
