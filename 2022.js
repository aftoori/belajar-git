const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits.at(2);
Get the third element of fruits:

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits[2];
The at() method returns an indexed element from an array.

The at() method returns the same as [].

The at() method is supported in all modern browsers since March 2022:

Chrome 92	Edge 92	Firefox 90	Safari 15.4	Opera 78

Note
Many languages allows negative bracket indexing like [-1] to access elements from the end of an object / array / string.

This is not possible in JavaScript, because [] is used for accessing both arrays and objects. obj[-1] refers to the value of key -1, not to the last property of the object.

The at() method was introduced in ES2022 to solve this problem.

JavaScript String at()
ES2022 intoduced the string method at():

Examples
Get the third letter of name:

const name = "W3Schools";
let letter = name.at(2);
Get the third letter of name:

const name = "W3Schools";
let letter = name[2];

RegExp d Modifier
ES2022 added the /d modifier to express the start and end of the match.

Example
let text = "aaaabb";
let result = text.match(/(aa)(bb)/d);
RegExp Modifiers are used to spescfy case-insensitive, and other global searches:

Modifier	Description	Try it
i	Perform case-insensitive matching	
g	Perform a global match (find all)	
m	Perform multiline matching	
d	Perform substring matches (New in ES2022)	
Object hasOwn
ES2022 provides a safe way to check if a property is the own property of an object.

Object.hasOwn() is similar to Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty but supports all object types.

Example
Object.hasOwn(myObject, age)
Error Cause
ES2022 let you specify the reason behind an error with error.cause.

Example
try { connectData(); } catch (err) { throw new Error("Connecting failed.", { cause: err }); }
