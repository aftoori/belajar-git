let x = 999999999999999;
let y = 9999999999999999; // too big
BigInt Example
let x = 9999999999999999;
let y = 9999999999999999n;
To create a BigInt, append n to the end of an integer or call BigInt():

Example
let x = 1234567890123456789012345n;
let y = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345)
The JavaScript typeof a BigInt is "bigint":

Example
let x = BigInt(999999999999999);
let type = typeof x;
BigInt is supported in all modern browsers since September 2020:

JavaScript String matchAll()
Before ES2020 there was no string method that could be used to search for all occurrences of a string in a string.

Example
const iterator = text.matchAll("Cats");
If the parameter is a regular expression, the global flag (g) must be set set, otherwise a TypeError is thrown.

Example
const iterator = text.matchAll(/Cats/g);
If you want to search case insensitive, the insensitive flag (i) must be set:

Example
const iterator = text.matchAll(/Cats/gi);
Note
ES2021 introduced the string method replaceAll().

The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

JavaScript Promise.allSettled()
The Promise.allSettled() method returns a single Promise from a list of promises.

Example
// Create a Promise
const myPromise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 200, "King");
});

// Create another Promise
const myPromise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Queen");
});

// Settle All
Promise.allSettled([myPromise1, myPromise2]).then((results) =>
  results.forEach((x) => myDisplay(x.status)),
);
Promise.allSettled() is supported in all modern browsers since March 2020:
