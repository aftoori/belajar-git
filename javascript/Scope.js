{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.

Example
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
Local Scope
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, are LOCAL to the function:

Example
// code here can NOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  // code here CAN use carName
}

// code here can NOT use carName
Local variables have Function Scope:

They can only be accessed from within the function.

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

Function Scope
JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

They all have Function Scope:

function myFunction() {
  var carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}
function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}
function myFunction() {
  const carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}
Global JavaScript Variables
A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

Example
let carName = "Volvo";
// code here can use carName

function myFunction() {
// code here can also use carName
}
A global variable has Global Scope:

All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. 

Global Scope
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

They all have Global Scope:

var x = 2;       // Global scope
let x = 2;       // Global scope
const x = 2;       // Global scope
JavaScript Variables
In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.

Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.

Automatically Global
If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.

This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function.

Example
myFunction();

// code here can use carName

function myFunction() {
  carName = "Volvo";
}
Strict Mode
All modern browsers support running JavaScript in "Strict Mode".

You will learn more about how to use strict mode in a later chapter of this tutorial.

In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.

Global Variables in HTML
With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment.

In HTML, the global scope is the window object.

Global variables defined with the var keyword belong to the window object:

Example
var carName = "Volvo";
// code here can use window.carName
Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object:

Example
let carName = "Volvo";
// code here can not use window.carName
