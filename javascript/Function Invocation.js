function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
myFunction(10, 2);           // Will return 20
The function above does not belong to any object. But in JavaScript there is always a default global object.

In HTML the default global object is the HTML page itself, so the function above "belongs" to the HTML page.

In a browser the page object is the browser window. The function above automatically becomes a window function.

Note
This is a common way to invoke a JavaScript function, but not a very good practice.
Global variables, methods, or functions can easily create name conflicts and bugs in the global object.

myFunction() and window.myFunction() is the same function:

Example
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
window.myFunction(10, 2);    // Will also return 20
What is this?
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
Note
this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.

The Global Object
When a function is called without an owner object, the value of this becomes the global object.

In a web browser the global object is the browser window.

This example returns the window object as the value of this:

Example
let x = myFunction();            // x will be the window object

function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
Invoking a function as a global function, causes the value of this to be the global object.
Using the window object as a variable can easily crash your program.

Invoking a Function as a Method
In JavaScript you can define functions as object methods.

The following example creates an object (myObject), with two properties (firstName and lastName), and a method (fullName):

Example
const myObject = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
myObject.fullName();         // Will return "John Doe"
The fullName method is a function. The function belongs to the object. myObject is the owner of the function.

The thing called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code. In this case the value of this is myObject.

Test it! Change the fullName method to return the value of this:

Example
const myObject = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this;
  }
}

// This will return [object Object] (the owner object)
myObject.fullName();
Invoking a function as an object method, causes the value of this to be the object itself.


// This is a function constructor:
function myFunction(arg1, arg2) {
  this.firstName = arg1;
  this.lastName  = arg2;
}

// This creates a new object
const myObj = new myFunction("John", "Doe");

// This will return "John"
myObj.firstName;
