img {
  float: right;
}

Example - float: left;
The following example specifies that an image should float to the left in a text:

PineappleLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac...

Example
img {
  float: left;
}
Example - No float
In the following example the image will be displayed just where it occurs in the text (float: none;):

Pineapple Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor. Maecenas nisl est, ultrices nec congue eget, auctor vitae massa. Fusce luctus vestibulum augue ut aliquet. Mauris ante ligula, facilisis sed ornare eu, lobortis in odio. Praesent convallis urna a lacus interdum ut hendrerit risus congue. Nunc sagittis dictum nisi, sed ullamcorper ipsum dignissim ac...

Example
img {
  float: none;
}
Example - Float Next To Each Other
Normally div elements will be displayed on top of each other. However, if we use float: left we can let elements float next to each other:

Example
div {
  float: left;
  padding: 15px;
}

.div1 {
  background: red;
}

.div2 {
  background: yellow;
}

.div3 {
  background: green;
}
div1 {
  float: left;
}

div2 {
  clear: left;
}

The clearfix Hack
If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem:

Without Clearfix

With Clearfix

Example
.clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}
The overflow: auto clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and padding (else you might see scrollbars). The new, modern clearfix hack however, is safer to use, and the following code is used for most webpages:

Example
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
You will learn more about the ::after pseudo-element in a later chapter.

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.box {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%; /* three boxes (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */
  padding: 50px; /* if you want space between the images */
}
What is box-sizing?

You can easily create three floating boxes side by side. However, when you add something that enlarges the width of each box (e.g. padding or borders), the box will break. The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in the box's total width (and height), making sure that the padding stays inside of the box and that it does not break.

You can read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing Chapter.

Images Side By Side
ItalyForestMountains
The grid of boxes can also be used to display images side by side:

Example
.img-container {
  float: left;
  width: 33.33%; /* three containers (use 25% for four, and 50% for two, etc) */
  padding: 5px; /* if you want space between the images */
}

Equal Height Boxes
In the previous example, you learned how to float boxes side by side with an equal width. However, it is not easy to create floating boxes with equal heights. A quick fix however, is to set a fixed height, like in the example below:

Box 1
Some content, some content, some content

Box 2
Some content, some content, some content

Some content, some content, some content

Some content, some content, some content

Example
.box {
  height: 500px;
}
However, this is not very flexible. It is ok if you can guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in them. But many times, the content is not the same. If you try the example above on a mobile phone, you will see that the second box's content will be displayed outside of the box. This is where CSS3 Flexbox comes in handy - as it can automatically stretch boxes to be as long as the longest box:

Example
Using Flexbox to create flexible boxes:

Box 1 - This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall. This is some text to make sure that the content gets really tall.
Box 2 - My height will follow Box 1.
Tip:  You can read more about the Flexbox Layout Module in our CSS Flexbox Chapter.

Navigation Menu
You can also use float with a list of hyperlinks to create a horizontal menu:

Example
HomeNewsContactAbout
Web Layout Example
It is also common to do entire web layouts using the float property:


Example
.header, .footer {
  background-color: grey;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px;
}

.column {
  float: left;
  padding: 15px;
}

.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}

.menu {
  width: 25%;
}

.content {
  width: 75%;
}
