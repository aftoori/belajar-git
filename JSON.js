The JSON Format Evaluates to JavaScript Objects
The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.

Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.

JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

JSON Data - A Name and a Value
JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties.

A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value:

"firstName":"John"
JSON names require double quotes. JavaScript names do not.

JSON Objects
JSON objects are written inside curly braces.

Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs:

{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}
JSON Arrays
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.

Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects:

"employees":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
In the example above, the object "employees" is an array. It contains three objects.

Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name).

Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object
A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.

For simplicity, this can be demonstrated using a string as input.

First, create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax:

let text = '{ "employees" : [' +
'{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';
Then, use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object:

const obj = JSON.parse(text);
Finally, use the new JavaScript object in your page:

Example
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
obj.employees[1].firstName + " " + obj.employees[1].lastName;
</script>
